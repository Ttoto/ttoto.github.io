I am an experienced engineer with a keen understanding of innovation and a passion for facing new challenges. My profession is in navigation, mapping and localization for smart devices. My passion for research and engineering has been recognised in various products, publications, patents, open-source projects and competitions.

Before diving into industry. I got my Ph.D.(supervisor: [Prof. Chih-yung WEN](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/researchgrp/cywen/index.php/en/index.html)), M.Sc.(supervisor: [Prof. Hubert Roth](https://www.eti.uni-siegen.de/rst/lehrstuhl/)) and B.Eng.(supervisor: [Prof. Shuhui Bu](http://www.adv-ci.com/blog/)) from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Universit√§t Siegen and Northwestern Polytechnical University Respectively. 

Currently, I am part of the dynamic team at Riemann Lab, Huawei, where I continue to push the boundaries of technological innovation. We offer both full-time and internship positions in Xi'an, Wuhan, Beijing, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. If you are willing to join the adventure, feel free to ping me!
